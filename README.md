Hi, I'm Maddi from Germany, 
me and my friend Jona created the "Lel-Company". Lel is like "Lol", but with "e". Have a Website from Surge, because my father isn't allowing us to setup our own server on his Laptop and modify the routers firewall or what we have to do for it. The site is named Lel.surge.sh (thanks to @Surge). There you can upload own pictures of the Lel logo. Whoever is trying to upload some freaky ahh pics will be BANNED! Visit our website right now and join the Lel COMMUNITY.



IF THERE ARE ANY MISTAKES IN THOS TEXT PLEASE CONTACT ME ON MATTI@BBLOG.DDNSS.DE .
